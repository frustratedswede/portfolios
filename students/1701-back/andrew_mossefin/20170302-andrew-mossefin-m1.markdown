# Andrew Mossefin - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

>* In this module, i wanted to learn how to build beyond simple logic programs. It was exciting to learn how to actually build a full app from the ground floor and databases, all the way to the end user view. I also wanted to learn how to effectively cooperate with a full group of several people on a project as opposed to just a single partner.

## Self-Assessment

| Section | Category | Score (optional) |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 3 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 2 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 3 |

>* Personal items aside, I'll be the first to admit that while Ruby was a learning process, it didn't completely challenge me. Rails, however, absolutely challenged me. Growth mindset was a difficult thing to graple with and improve on in this mod.

>* I had a couple of major takeaways from the final assessment. The first was that just because you were able to figure out how to perform something one day, does not mean you will retain that ability if you shift focus onto something else shortly after. Second, was that I really have a weakness with testing that I need to improve. In mod-1 I had trouble implementing TDD even though I could accurately write a working program without it, and it took until the last couple of weeks in the mod to learn how to use testing (minitest) to complement my code. In this mod, TDD with RSpec was ESSENTIAL for furthering your code with new features. While i understood the Rails processes, I didn't take the time to truly understand how to decifer RSpec failiures, and that hurt me. When Beth aptly pointed this out, it made perfect sense as far as where I would get thrown off. I have to continue to try and train myself not to put the cart before the horse, like I've done in other aspects of my life. And, likely most importantly, I guess what I really need help with is leanring how to ask for help.

>* Created the [finest picklery](https://wecanpicklethat.herokuapp.com/) in all the land!
>* This project was truly a great experience. I'm almost thankful that I had to miss 'bikeshare', just so that I could immediately see how to work well as a group. I never could have imagined in earlier pairs how useful waffle.io can be. But when you have multiple people on different tasks and sending multiple pull requests to be reviewed and merged, it was an absolute lifesaver. I also ganed the experience of a 1-to-3 driver-navigator session while developing. While I still prefer one-on-one code pairing for features (too many cooks in the kitchen), it was valuable to learn the dynamic of how to each give your own imput without talking over anyone or stepping on toes.
